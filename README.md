**Part 1**
**Git and Github Toturial**
git lets you manage your project. It lets you create different branches for your project when adding new features so your original project won't get messed up. It is also helpful in working with projects as a team as everything is contained in a repo that multiple people can work on. 

Step 1: Install git and create a Github account
Step 2: Create a local git repository
Step 3: Add a new file to the repo
Step 4: Add a file to the staging enviornment
Step 5: Create a commit
Step 6: Create a new branch
Step 7: Create a new repository on Github
Step 8: Push a branch to Github
Step 9: Create a pull request (PR)
Step 10: Merge PR
Step 11: Get changes on Github back to your computer. Use git pull origin master command to get changes to your computer and match it with your github repo. 

**Webstorm**: WebStorm is an integrated development environment for coding in JavaScript and its related technologies, including TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, HTML, and style sheets. Just like IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs, WebStorm makes your development experience more enjoyable, automating routine work and helping you handle complex tasks with ease.

* **Branch**: A version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. Branches can be a new version of a repository, experimental changes, or personal forks of a repository for users to alter and test changes.
* **Clone**: A clone is a copy of a repository or the action of copying a repository. When cloning a repository into another branch, the new branch becomes a remote-tracking branch that can talk upstream to its origin branch (via pushes, pulls, and fetches).
* **Fetch**: By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying that branch’s files to your workstation. Multiple branches can be fetched at once, and you can rename the branches when running the command to suit your needs.
* **GIT**: Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
* **Github**: GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
* **Merge**: Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another (traditionally master) branch. These commits are usually first requested via pull request before being merged by a project maintainer.
* **Merge Conflict**:  merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
* **Push**: Updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. You are literally “pushing” your changes onto the remote.
* **Pull**: If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, that someone can put in a pull request. Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch.
* **Remote**: A copy of the original branch. When you clone a branch, that new branch is a remote, or clone. Remotes can talk to the origin branch, as well as other remotes for the repository, to make communication between working branches easier.
* **Repository**: In many ways, you can think of a Git repository as a directory that stores all the files, folders, and content needed for your project. What it actually is, is the object database of the project, storing everything from the files themselves, to the versions of those files, commits, deletions, et cetera.
